## üèÜ Experience

### **Carriere break** *(Dec 2023 - Aug 2024)*

```csharp
public class Sabbatical
{
    public void ExplanationNotExcuse()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(@"Many employers and recruiters ask me about my career break, so I‚Äôd like to clear up 
        any misunderstandings. There is a war in my country‚Äîif anyone hasn‚Äôt noticed. I faced personal challenges, 
        including family difficulties and health issues. I struggled with severe spinal pain and ultimately decided 
        to return to my hometown after living in another city. I had to gather the remnants of my health and 
        relocate hundreds of miles back home.
        
        And you know what? I have the right to take a pause in my career and dedicate time to myself and my family.
